# Heart-Disease-Detection-Model
Decision Tree model to predict heart disease using attributes like age, sex, blood sugar, etc.

-- Predicted heart disease using decision tree models based on age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level and 9 other attributes with 85% accuracy

-- Developed decision tree models using Python and open-sourced libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to monitor and visualize model performance and the confusion matrix

-- Improved the accuracy of prediction from 74% to 85% using cost complexity pruning and cross validation techniques to determine the optimized alpha

-- Identified missing data, pre-processed datasets, and implemented One-Hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling

-- Utilized both categorical and continuous data to develop the decision tree model for heart disease prediction

-- Documented the model building process (GitHub) and presented the results to team members
